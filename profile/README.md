# 📒OpenChip2035
Hi, there! This project targets on simple, open, free and accessible SOC chip design to everyone.

# 🚀RoadMap

- - [ ] A UART transmitter peripheral based on the wishbone bus, used as a template for future RTL, naming style, etc.
- - [ ] A hex bus to Wishbone bus module (hb2wbmaster), used to test wishbone peripherals.
- - [ ] A uart to bus module, refer to this [link](https://github.com/freecores/uart2bus).
- - [ ] A UART receiver based on wishbone bus.
- - [ ] To explore the SOC architecture design, the following issues need to be solved, which will be used to pay attention to the construction of future modules:
    + CPU architecture design, Harvard and von Neumann architecture, what does pipeline mean?
    + How the program is loaded and run, most likely ROM and RAM are required.
    + Interrupt mechanism, how the peripheral interrupt source is connected to the CPU and triggers the corresponding interrupt.
- - [ ] Timer
- - [ ] Spi
- - [ ] I2C
- - [ ] GPIO Matrix
